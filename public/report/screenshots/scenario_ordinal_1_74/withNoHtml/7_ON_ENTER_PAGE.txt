Help support TATE
Please add Gift Aid at no extra cost, so that we can claim tax back from the government. Gift Aid helps us keep art accessible for everyone.
I want to add Gift Aid at no extra cost
Yes please
No thanks
I want to Gift Aid any donations made to Tate Gallery now, in the future and in the past four years. I am a UK taxpayer and I understand that if I pay less Income and/or Capital Gains Tax than the amount of Gift Aid claimed on all my donations in the relevant tax year, it is my responsibility to pay any difference. I will inform you should my tax status change. Gift Aid is only claimed on the individual element of my membership (£78/90). We will always act on your final Gift Aid choice.
